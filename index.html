        <h1>A baby shark.</h1>
        <p>Slate is a simple theme that I created for the <a href="http://google.com">Google</a>. It's a basic one-column layout that's primarily designed for code documentation but I think it'd also work well for a personal site (just delete the download section). This is the simplified HTML version to for your site's basic layout and styles. Clone these files and replace this content to get the ball rolling.</p>

        <h3>We all like making lists</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Red Apples</li>
          <li>Purple Grapes</li>
          <li>Green Kiwifruits</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Let's get crazy:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor
            sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit
            mi posuere lectus.</p>

            <p>Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet
            vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum
            sit amet velit.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.</p></li>
        </ol>

        
        <p>Some people seem to like definition lists</p>

        <dl>
        <dt>Lower cost</dt>
          <dd>The new version of this product costs significantly less than the previous one!</dd>
          <dt>Easier to use</dt>
          <dd>We've changed the product so that it's much easier to use!</dd>
        </dl>


        <h3>If you need to blame someone, the best way to do so is by quoting them:</h3>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Or perhaps someone a little less eloquent:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I
        could plan for it... I'm sure something will pop into my head here in
        the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to
        come up with answer, but it hadn't yet...</p>

        <p>I don't want to sound like
        I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't - you
        just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet
        as I should be in coming up with one.</p>
        </blockquote>
